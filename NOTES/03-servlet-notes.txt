>>>>>>>>What is a server?
>Is a computer that is running server software

>>What is server software?
>software that is used to receive web requests and send web responses
>In our case, our server software is....TOMCAT!!!!

>>What is a Servlet?
>A servlet is a java class that is tasked with handling a URI(s) inside of your server

>>What is the servlet heirarchy?

	(Servlet, interface)
		|	init(), service(), destroy(),
		|	getServletConfig(), getServletInfo()
		|
	(GenericServlet, abstract class)
		|	implements init(), destroy()
		|	implements getServletConfig(), getServletInfo()
		|	creates new method getServletContext()
		|
	(HttpServlet, abstract class)
		|	implements service()
		|
		|
	(OurCustomServlet, class)



additonally, we have:

(HttpServletRequest, interface)
(HttpServletResponse, interface)




>>>What is a lifecyle in development? (not the SDLC)
>A lifecycle is a series of methods/steps that will be taken in a framework/technology.
>For example, in Servlets the lifecycle are methods that are called on a servlet during the time the servlet is "alive"


>>>What is the servlet lifecyle?
	init()
		creates and initializes the servlet object
		will be run a single time in the lifecyle
		will be run WHEN the server starts up OR when the first request happens
			(there is a way to configure this)
	service()
		the servlet will SERVICE the Http Request
		(that is to say, it will perform logic for the Http Request)
		will be run the same amount of times that we have Http Request
		(that is to say, it will be run MANY times)
		will be run WHEN we have an Http Request
	destroy()
		destroys the servlet object
		will be run a single time in the lifecyle
		will be run WHEN the server shutsdown
			(or if there is some fatal error with the servlet)
