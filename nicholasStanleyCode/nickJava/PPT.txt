Twin primes and Primitive Pythagorean Triples

This paper is about the relation between Primitive Pythagorean Triples (PPT) 
and the twin prime conjecture. It is known that there is inifinitely many 
Primitive Pythagorean Triples. A (PPT) is a right triangle where A is odd; B is even; gcd(a,b,c) = 1
thus the infamous triple (3,4,5) is a PPT. the Sum of Squares can be shown to be 
congruent to a " 4 modulo 1 " operator ,  and that the hypotenuse is also of the set of the sum of squares.
lets take the PPT ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) for this we will use the hypotenuse 5 which is prime
and has twin primes at minus two and plus two
	5 - 2 = 3 PRIME ,  5 + 2 =  7 PRIME
the next PPT ( 5 , 12 , 13 )
	13 - 2 = 11 PRIME , 13 + 2 = 15 composite
the next PPT  ( 15 , 8 , 17 )
	17 - 2 = 15 composite , 17 + 2 = 19 PRIME
and so on.  there is inifinitely many primes, there is inifinitely many 1 modulo 4 primes, there is infinitely many 3 modulo 4 primes 
there is infinitely many Primitive Pythagorean Triples , there is infinitely many twin primes .
