>ls
    >>list files in current directory (aka folder)
>ls -a
    >>list even the hidden files, the "-a" is a command flag
>cd
    >>change directory (directory=folder)
    >>  "cd /" is the command to get to the root directory (the highest level folder possible)
    >>  "cd ~" is the command to get to the home directory (the default directory, that is not necessarily the highest level folder)
    >>  "cd .." is how you get to your PARENT directory, so ".." means parent directory
    >>  what does "." mean then? It's the CURRENT directory
>pwd
    >>print working directory
>mkdir
    >>make a directory
>rmdir
    >>remove a director
>touch
