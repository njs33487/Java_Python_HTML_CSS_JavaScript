	/*
	 * Create a method named "solution" that takes in no arguments.
	 * It simply returns the value of a public instance scoped variable called "targetVariable".
	 * targetVariable should be a string with the value of "start".
	 * 
	 *  
	 *  Example:
	 *  		With no input
	 *  		This method would return "start"
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  NOW....override this method in a class named "ExerciseFiveChild".
	 *  In that overridden method you will return the value of a shadowed version of
	 *  "targetVariable" that has an initial value of "end".
	 *  In this new class you will ALSO create another method called "secondSolution"
	 *  that returns the value of the original (non-shadowed) value
	 *  
	 *  Example:
	 *  		With no input
	 *  		This method would return "end"
