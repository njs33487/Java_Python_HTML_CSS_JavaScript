	 * Create a method named "solution" that takes
	 *  in two int arguments "m" and "c". It will then return these values multiplied together.
	 * 
	 *  
	 *  Example:
	 *  		With input 5 and 6
	 *  		This method would return 30
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  NOW....override this method in a class named "ExerciseFourChild".
	 *  In that overridden method you will use Einstein's famous relativity equation
	 *  to operate upon the arguments. Return the result of that equation.
	 *  (Domain Knowledge - you may need to research that equation)
	 *  
	 *  Example:
	 *  		With input 30 and 80
	 *  		This method would return 192000
