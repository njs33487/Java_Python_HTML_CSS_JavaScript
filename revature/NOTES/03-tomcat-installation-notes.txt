>>>Download tomcat
> https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
> download specifically the ***Binary Distributions CORE (zip or tar file) *** and the ***Source Code Distributions (zip or tar files) ***
> extract the CORE, not the source code


>>>Integrating Tomcat with our workspace ( do this for EVERY workspace, not every project)
	window -> preferences -> server -> runtime environments -> add
	*search for tomcat version 9 because that's the version we downloaded)*
	*click next*
	*click browse*
	*now navigate to tomcat CORE folder, NOT THE SRC FOLDER*
	*select, then apply and close*

>>>FOR A MAC
	Spring Tools Suite -> preferences.....





(perform the following three steps EVERY war project, not JUST every workspace)

>>>>>>NOW, after we've created a WAR project, let's create a web.xml to git rid of that red X
	right click project -> java EE tools -> click "generate deployment descriptor stub"


>>>>>>>>NEXT, we need the servlet-api dependency

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.servlet/javax.servlet-api -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.1</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>


>>>>>Also consider right clicking your tomcat in the servers window -> add and remove ->
	click your project



>>>>>>>>>>>>IF you want to change tomcat's port
>you can double click tomcat in the servers window of sts
	>change the HTTP/1.1 port THEN SAVE YOUR FILE
	
	
	
	
	
	
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>IF YOU SEE THIS ERROR: 
			Could not initialize class org.apache.maven.plugin.war.util.WebappStructureSerializer


>>>>>THEN this is the solution (put this in your pom.xml file IF you have the exception above)

<build>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.3.1</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
    <finalName>check</finalName>
  </build>
	
	
>>NOTE: this "finalName" will actually change the name of the project in tomcat so that URL also needs to change
