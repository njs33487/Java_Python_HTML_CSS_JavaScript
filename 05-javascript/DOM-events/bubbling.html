        What is bubbling?
        >the process of events propagating to their parent elements to trigger even more
            events of the same type. So if a click event fires, that click event will
            be passed to all parents, grandparents, etc to trigger more click events.

        What is capturing?
        >the process of events propogating from parent to child, the opposite of bubbling
