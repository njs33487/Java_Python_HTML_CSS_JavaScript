		 * Have you ever heard of an armstrong number?
		 * 		In numerical number theory, the Armstrong number definition is the number in any given number base,
		 * 		which forms the total of the same number, when each of its digits is raised to the power of the number
		 * 		of digits in the number.
		 * 
		 * 		For example, using a simple number 153 and the decimal system, we see there are 3 digits in it.
		 * 		If we do a simple mathematical operation of raising each of its digits to the power of 3, and then totalling
		 * 		the sum obtained, we get 153. That is 1 to the power of 3 5 to the power of 3 3 to the power of three is 1 125 27 153.
		 * 		This can also be represented as 1^3 5^3 3^3=153.
		 * 
		 * 		For 0, the operation is 0^1=0
		 *
 		 *		For 1, the operation is 1^1=1
		 *
 		 *		For 153, the operation is 1^3 5^3 3^3=153
		 *
 		 *		For 370 the operation is 3^3 7^3 0^3=370
		 *
 		 *		For 371 the operation is 3^3 7^3 1^3=371
		 *
 		 *		For 407 the operation is 4^3 0^3 7^3=407
		 *
 		 *		For 9474 the operation is 9^4 4^4 7^4 4^4=9474
		 * 
		 * Description:
		 * 		Create logic that determines if n is an armstrong number of not. Then return a boolean true or false appropriately.
		 *
		 *	Example:
		 *		perform(371) should return true
		 *		and
		 *		perform(372) should return false
