	 * Create a method named "solution" that takes
	 *  in a string array argument. It'll then change the value of the SECOND
	 *  TO LAST element to "AT LEAST IM NOT LAST". The method will have a void
	 *  return type.
	 *  
	 *  Overload this method to work with ints. Change the second to last value
	 *  to -5; 
	 *  
	 *  If the array argument doesn't have at least two elements then throw an
	 *  IllegalArgumentException.
	 *  
	 *  example:
	 *  		For input of ["one", "two", "three"]
	 *  		the method should modify the array so it contains
	 *  			["one", "AT LEAST IM NOT LAST", "three]
	 *  example2:
	 *  		For input of [5, 8, -6]
	 *  		the method should modify the array so it contains
	 *  			[5, -5, -6]
